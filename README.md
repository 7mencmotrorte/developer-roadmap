If you are a fan of fantasy, romance, and comedy anime, you might have heard of Zero no Tsukaima, or The Familiar of Zero, a popular light novel series by Noboru Yamaguchi that was adapted into four anime seasons.

If you want to watch Zero no Tsukaima Season 2 English dubbed, you might have some difficulty finding it online. The anime was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in North America, but the company went out of business before releasing the second season on DVD. The license was later acquired by Sentai Filmworks, but they only released the second season on Blu-ray with Japanese audio and English subtitles. Therefore, there is no official English dub for the second season of Zero no Tsukaima.
     
However, there are some unofficial ways to watch Zero no Tsukaima Season 2 English dubbed online. One way is to use a streaming site that offers fan-made English dubs for anime. These sites are not authorized by the original creators or licensors of the anime, and they may have low-quality audio or video. They may also contain ads or malware that could harm your device. Some examples of these sites are [AnimeKisa] and [Bilibili].
     
Another way to watch Zero no Tsukaima Season 2 English dubbed online is to use a VPN service that allows you to access geo-restricted content from other countries. For example, you could use a VPN to connect to a server in Australia or New Zealand, where the second season of Zero no Tsukaima was released on DVD with an English dub by Madman Entertainment. You could then use a streaming service that offers the anime in those regions, such as [AnimeLab](https://www.animelab.com/shows/the-familiar-of-zero). However, this method may require you to pay for a VPN subscription and a streaming subscription, and it may violate the terms of service of the streaming provider.
     
In conclusion, if you want to watch Zero no Tsukaima Season 2 English dubbed online, you have to either use an unofficial streaming site that offers fan-made dubs or use a VPN service that lets you access official dubs from other regions. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and you should be careful about the quality and legality of the content you are watching. Alternatively, you could watch the second season of Zero no Tsukaima with Japanese audio and English subtitles, which are widely available on legal streaming sites such as [Crunchyroll] or [Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/shows/the-familiar-of-zero/).
